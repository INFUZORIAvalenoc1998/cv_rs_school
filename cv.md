## Education and work experience
 I am studying at the Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics, was an excellent student at school. I have no experience in IT. But, I'd experience  in other spheres (for example, a teacher in a childrenâ€™s camp, a packer,copywriter), including on a free of charge basis.

 ## English practice
 I've studied english for 13 years now. I understand that I shouldn't even try to compete with a native speaker, but I can admit that I have a really extensive progress on this field. Some years ago I tried to communicate with a native speaker and I can say that thees experience was really unique and unforgotten.
